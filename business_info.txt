ABOUT: IPSITA COMPUTERS PTE LTD, established in 1994, is a pioneering Information Technology company in Bangladesh. With over 25 years of experience, we are dedicated to setting the highest service standards in software and web application development, both locally and internationally. In 2018, we proudly earned the Quality Management System ISO-9001:2015 Certificate. Our journey began with identifying our clients' fundamental needs, automating their workflows, and providing user-friendly platforms that put information at their fingertips. We prioritize excellent customer service, addressing issues promptly, and guiding them toward a brighter technological future. Our marketing efforts take a back seat to the strong word-of-mouth referrals from our loyal, long-term clients who know, like, and trust us. As a result, we stay engaged year-round, working on diverse and mission-critical projects, including innovative solutions for government offices, educational institutions, corporations, SMEs, individuals, and foreign clients. We are active in ICT-based training, empowering students through real-life projects, helping many secure jobs or become successful freelancers. Our hardware and related product sales division has been serving clients since our inception. With five copyrighted software solutions and dedicated teams led by two directors, both alumni of the University of Dhaka, we continue to excel in delivering innovative and challenging projects across various sectors.

Mission: Our mission is to leverage our expertise in IT to provide innovative solutions that address real-world challenges and improve the quality of life for individuals and communities.

Vision: To empower individuals and organizations through innovative technology solutions that enhance their lives, drive positive change, and create a better future for all.
